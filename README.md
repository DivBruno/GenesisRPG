# GenesisRPG
Developing a program to automate a custom RPG system. 

OBJECTIVES:
* A roll system with custom, predefined and favorites rolls. 
* A way to see your character sheet, edit it and save the changes.
* As a bonus, a mode to modify your CS without saving it (useful during battles, for example).

FUTURE: 
* I'll try to make a UI, never made one so wish me luck xD.
* Maybe other features, if i come up with good ideas.

STATUS: 
Still very WIP, not optimzed and not compatible with other RPG systems, unless adapted.


As a reminder: The project is open-source and open to any suggestion. Just dont try to sell it commercially and/or as your own, and everything is good.
